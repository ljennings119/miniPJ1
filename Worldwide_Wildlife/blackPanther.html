						</header><div class="content">
							<p>The black panther is not a distinct species but a general term used to describe melanistic (black-coated) individuals of certain big cat species, most commonly the leopard (Panthera pardus) of Africa and Asia, and the jaguar (Panthera onca) of Central and South America. Melanism is a genetic variation caused by an overproduction of the dark pigment melanin, which gives the animal&apos;s fur its deep black coloration.</p>

							<h4>Biology and Genetics</h4>
							<p>Melanism in big cats is a recessive trait in leopards but dominant in jaguars, meaning it appears more frequently in jaguar populations. Despite their dark fur, the typical rosette or spot patterns are still present — they can often be seen under bright sunlight or with infrared photography. This trait may offer evolutionary advantages, such as better camouflage for hunting in dense forests or protection from sunlight.</p>
							
							<h4>Habitat and Distribution</h4>
							<p>Black panthers are found in a range of habitats, depending on their species. Black leopards are most common in the tropical rainforests of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and parts of Africa, where dense foliage provides excellent cover. Black jaguars are mostly found in the Amazon Basin and other parts of Central and South America, where thick jungles and shadowy environments make their dark coats ideal for stealth.</p>

							<h4>Behavior and Hunting</h4>
							<p>Black panthers are solitary and territorial predators, mainly nocturnal, which makes their dark coloring even more effective for stalking prey at night. Their diet includes deer, wild pigs, monkeys, birds, and smaller mammals. They are strong climbers and swimmers, using their agility to ambush prey from trees or near water sources.</p>

							<h4>Adaptations and Survival</h4>
							<p>The melanistic trait may provide adaptive advantages in certain environments. In dense forests, their black coats make them harder to spot by both prey and potential threats. This has helped black panthers become symbols of stealth, power, and mystery across cultures.</p>

							<h4>Conservation</h4>
							<p>Like their spotted counterparts, black panthers face threats from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. As apex predators, they play a vital role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by controlling prey populations. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting leopards and jaguars — such as habitat preservation and anti-poaching programs — also benefit black panther populations.</p>

							<h4>Cultural Significance</h4>
							<p>Black panthers have long fascinated people around the world. They are often portrayed as symbols of strength, courage, and mystery in folklore, literature, and popular culture. Their striking appearance and elusive nature make them one of the most iconic animals in the wild.</p>
