							<p>Axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) are remarkable amphibians native to the ancient lakes of Mexico, primarily Lake Xochimilco near Mexico City. They are a type of salamander but are best known for a rare trait called neoteny, which means they retain their larval features—such as their feathery external gills and aquatic lifestyle—throughout their adult lives. Unlike most amphibians, axolotls do not typically undergo metamorphosis to become land-dwelling adults.</p>

							<h4>Habitat and Conservation</h4>
							<p>In the wild, axolotls once thrived in the connected waterways of Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco. However, urbanization, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species like tilapia and carp have drastically reduced their numbers. Today, they are listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, with only a few small populations surviving in canals and artificial habitats. Conservation efforts are underway to restore their natural environment and breed them in captivity for reintroduction.</p>

							<h4>Biology and Regeneration</h4>
							<p>Axolotls are famous for their regenerative abilities—they can regrow entire limbs, parts of their heart, spinal cord, and even parts of their brain without scarring. Scientists study them to better understand tissue regeneration and potential medical applications for humans. They breathe using a combination of external gills, lungs, and skin, allowing them to survive in low-oxygen environments.</p>

							<h4>Appearance and Variants</h4>
							<p>Wild axolotls are typically dark brown or black with speckles, which helps them blend into their lake beds. Captive breeding has produced several color morphs, including leucistic (pale pink with red gills and black eyes), golden albino, melanoid (all black), and copper varieties. They usually grow to around 9–12 inches (23–30 cm) long.</p>

							<h4>Diet and Behavior</h4>
							<p>Axolotls are carnivorous, feeding on worms, insects, small crustaceans, and fish. In captivity, they&apos;re often fed bloodworms, brine shrimp, or specially made sinking pellets. They are generally solitary and calm, though they can nip at each other if kept in close quarters, especially during feeding.</p>

							<h4>As Pets</h4>
							<p>Axolotls have become popular aquarium pets because of their unique look and low activity level, but they require specific care. They need cool, clean, still water—ideally around 60–64°F (16–18°C)—as higher temperatures can stress or kill them. A fine sand or bare-bottom tank prevents injury, and regular water changes are essential to maintain health.</p>

							<h4>Importance</h4>
							<p>Beyond their appeal as pets, axolotls are vital to scientific research and cultural history. They were considered sacred in Aztec mythology, associated with the god Xolotl, who was said to have transformed into one to avoid sacrifice. Today, they remain a symbol of resilience and regeneration, representing hope for biodiversity and scientific discovery.</p>
