							<p>The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is one of the most extraordinary and distinctive animals on Earth. Native to eastern Australia and Tasmania, it&apos;s a semi-aquatic mammal that challenges traditional classifications because it shares traits with birds, reptiles, and mammals.</p>

							<h4>Classification and Uniqueness</h4>
							<p>The platypus belongs to a small group of mammals called monotremes, which are the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. There are only five known monotreme species — the platypus and four species of echidna (spiny anteaters). Despite laying eggs, the platypus is warm-blooded, produces milk, and has fur, placing it firmly in the mammal category.</p>

							<h4>Physical Features</h4>
							<p>Platypuses have a flat, duck-like bill that is soft and rubbery, not hard like a bird&apos;s beak. Their bill is covered in electroreceptors that detect the tiny electric fields produced by the muscle movements of their prey — a rare ability among mammals. They also have webbed feet for swimming and a broad, flat tail used for storing fat and helping with movement in water. Their dense, waterproof fur keeps them warm in cold rivers and streams. Male platypuses have a unique feature: venomous spurs on their hind legs. During mating season, they can deliver a painful sting capable of incapacitating smaller animals (and causing intense pain in humans, though it&apos;s not deadly).</p>

							<h4>Habitat and Behavior</h4>
							<p>Platypuses live in freshwater environments such as rivers, streams, and lakes, where they dig burrows into the banks for shelter. They are mostly nocturnal and crepuscular (active at night or dawn and dusk), spending much of their time hunting underwater. When hunting, a platypus closes its eyes, ears, and nose, relying entirely on electroreception and touch to find prey like insects, larvae, worms, and small crustaceans. It stores captured food in cheek pouches and eats once it surfaces..</p>

							<h4>Reproduction</h4>
							<p>Female platypuses lay one to three leathery eggs and incubate them by curling around them in a burrow. After hatching, the mother nurses her young, but she doesn&apos;t have nipples — milk seeps through special pores in her skin and collects on her fur for the babies to lap up.</p>

							<h4>Conservation and Importance</h4>
							<p>The platypus is currently listed as Near Threatened due to habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change, which reduce water quality and food availability. Conservation programs in Australia focus on protecting waterways and monitoring populations.</p>

							<h4>Fun Facts</h4>
							<p>The first scientists who saw a platypus specimen in the 18th century thought it was a hoax, believing someone had sewn together parts of different animals. It&apos;s one of the few mammals with electroreception, a trait more common in fish like sharks. Despite its odd mix of features, the platypus is perfectly adapted to its environment — agile in water, stealthy while hunting, and built for life in cool, freshwater systems.</p>
